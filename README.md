Contains some C++ problem solutions from the first course of my BSU studies.

They were organized like using branches as folders, and I manually added files one-by-one to the folders :)
Good times.

## Branches
- *Algo* branch: contains my implementations of a linked list, treap, binary search tree and hash table (like std::unordered_map)
- *Ready* branch: contains solutions to the some of the problems from the BSU programming course, including some geometry, assembler, AVL-trees, 
and other problems
